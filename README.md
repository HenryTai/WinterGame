# Simple Guide



Remark:
1. Code clear; Try to make the code easier understandable, dont make it like a messy
2. Code with commments; Help other understand your code
3. Keep the pull request at most 1 of it in Github; In order to prevent code conflict
4. Don't accept your own pull request; Give other a chance to study your code and have double checking at the same time
5. Anyone should be responsible to check and accept pull request from other ppl (except your own one, refers to 4.);
