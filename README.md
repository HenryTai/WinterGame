# Simple Guide


Setup at ...\Documents\GitHub:
```
git clone <URL>
```

MAKE SURE YOU ARE IN THE GIT PROJECT FILE BEFORE YOU DO THE PROCEDURE BELOW:
```
...\Documents\GitHub\WinterGame

Upload to our project site:
- all changes made to your own local resp (files in your computer), you can repeat as many times as you want here
```
git add -A
git commit -m "put your simple commit message here"
```
- after finished the previous procedure, upload to your git resp
```
git push
```
- upload to our project resp
Go to github webpage, your github resp, click the green button "New pull request", and follow the instruction. (do not confirm the pull request, have a look at Remark 4.)


Update your local resp (files in your computer) from your git:
```
git pull origin
```



Remark:

1. Code clear; Try to make the code easier understandable, dont make it like a messy
2. Code with commments; Help other understand your code
3. Keep the pull request at most 1 of it in Github; In order to prevent code conflict
4. Don't accept your own pull request; Give other a chance to study your code and have double checking at the same time
5. Anyone should be responsible to check and accept pull request from other ppl (except your own one, refers to 4.);
