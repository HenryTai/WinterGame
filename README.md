# Simple Guide

Our target to make a game like this: http://www.4399.com/flash/166963_2.htm

Setup at ...\Documents\GitHub:
```
git clone <URL>
```



MAKE SURE YOU ARE IN THE GIT PROJECT FILE BEFORE YOU DO THE PROCEDURE BELOW:
```
...\Documents\GitHub\WinterGame
```


Upload to our project site:
- after your code something new
- all changes made to your own local repository (files in your computer), you can repeat as many times as you want here
```
git add -A
git commit -m "put your simple commit message here"
```
- after finished the previous procedure, upload to your github repository
```
git push
```
- upload to our project repository; remember write comment what have you mainly changed in the github (you ll see the field later)
Go to github webpage, your github repository, click the green button "New pull request", and follow the instruction. (do not confirm the pull request, have a look at Remark 4.)


Keep update with the project repository:
- update your github repository
Go to github webpage, your github repository, click the green button "New pull request";
Click compare across forks (if necessary), make base as your github repository and the compare as project repository;
Follow the procedure to accpet the update (this pull request should be confirmed by yourself only, so do it!)

- update your local repository (files in your computer) from your git:
```
git pull origin
```
- contribute your knowledge and skills to this project (do code)



Remark:

1. Code clear; Try to make the code easier understandable, dont make it like a messy
2. Code with commments; Help other understand your code
3. Keep the pull request at most 1 of it in Github; In order to prevent code conflict
4. Don't accept your own pull request; Give other a chance to study your code and have double checking at the same time
5. Anyone should be responsible to check and accept pull request from other ppl (except your own one, refers to 4.);
